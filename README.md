# ShopWise
As an online shopper, I want to have an easy access to the best prices on the internet and a way to get my favorite products from one search.

## Description
ShopWise is intended to help shoppers find the best prices and availability of their favorite products. 
Members are given quick and easy access to both Amazon and eBay product searches with just one click, so you can choose the best value for your money! Eventually, additional major shopping APIâ€™s will be added to give members more purchase options. Shoppers will sign up by entering an email address and choosing a password, and when logged in, they will be able to select any product category from the drop-down menu, and shop. The technologies used include Node and Express server, MySQL, Sequelize, and Boot snip for front end layout and design.
## Installation
This repo consists of front end and back end files. To run this app locally after cloning the repo, run npm install to get all the dependecies installed, then run the command line: node sever. Now open http://localhost:8080 in your browser of choice. All third parties API used here require personel API keys. Application will not work without valid API key. Register at https://rapidapi.com/ to get your free API key.

Deploy app soon to come. Still a working progress.
